      "description": "My 2008 undergraduate thesis consisted of a reversed engineered Chinese Online Judge, which we called the Xtreme Online Judge. It was deployed in my university (UCI) and served there as the basis for several programming competitions. Around 2010, the Xtreme Online Judge gave way to the Caribbean Online Judge, which was a technologically superior proposition on the same features and domain covered by the Xtreme. The COJ then presided the creation of programming contests in all relevant universities of the country, and ultimate culminated in the creation of the Caribbean Region of the ACM ICPC, of which the COJ was the underpin. I was involved as a developer, architect, evangelist and support engineer of the Xtreme and COJ from 2007 - 2010, and then from 2012 to 2015. The COJ stopped being actively developed in 2016. In 2018 its codebase was made public in github for everyone to fork it if they choose to. As of 2019, everyone related to the COJ and the ICPC is gone from the UCI, and the status of the COJ instance at UCI is uncertain, most likely retired.",
